# godot-chrisfurry's utilities

A small plugin that adds a few things I really really wanted, implimented kinda poorly.

## New classes

### Sprite Label

### SpriteFont

Fonts used for `SpriteLabel`, they work similar to how Gamemaker fonts work.

### ProgressBar2D

"We have ProgressBar at home."

This is a version of the progress bar that takes in textures, it also allows `AtlasTexture`s to repeat.
